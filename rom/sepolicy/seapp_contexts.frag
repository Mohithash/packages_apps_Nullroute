# Nullroute — seapp_contexts fragment.
#
# APPEND to device/lineage/sepolicy/common/private/seapp_contexts.
#
# ⚠ ORDER IS PART OF THE CONTRACT.
#
# This line MUST be inserted BEFORE any broader `isPrivApp=true` catch-all in
# the file it is merged into. If a catch-all such as
#
#     user=_app isPrivApp=true domain=priv_app type=privapp_data_file levelFrom=all
#
# is evaluated first, the app lands in priv_app, every nullroute_* grant in
# nullroute_app.te applies to a domain the app is never in, and the result is a
# device where the UI works, the index builds, the promotion succeeds, and netd
# blocks nothing — with no denial to explain why, because priv_app is simply not
# a domain that appears in any of our rules.
#
# Modern libselinux does sort entries by specificity (a `name=` match outranks a
# catch-all regardless of file position), so on most trees this would work
# either way. Treat that as a safety net, not as permission to be careless:
# the sort comparator has changed across releases, and there is no runtime
# signal when it goes wrong.
#
# VERIFY AFTER A BUILD:
#   adb shell ps -AZ | grep com.bestrom.nullroute
# must show u:r:nullroute_app:s0, not u:r:priv_app:s0.
# tools/ci_verify_image.sh asserts the ordering on the built image.
#
# A platform-signed app gets seinfo=platform automatically from
# mac_permissions.xml's default platform <signer> block. No new <signer> entry
# and no mac_permissions.xml edit is required.
#
# One line only: seapp_contexts matches on the PACKAGE name, so every process of
# the package — including any `:remote` process — resolves through this entry.

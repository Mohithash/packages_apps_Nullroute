# Nullroute — property type declarations.
#
# APPEND to device/lineage/sepolicy/common/private/property.te.
#
# These are the ONLY declarations of these two types. Do not repeat them in
# nullroute.te — declaring a property type twice fails the policy build.
#
# system_restricted_prop is the right macro here rather than
# system_internal_prop or system_public_prop:
#
#   * writes are gated by the explicit set_prop() calls in nullroute.te,
#     nullroute_app.te, nullroute_seed.te and nrctl.te, and nowhere else;
#   * reads are limited to coredomain. netd, nullroute_app, nullroute_seed and
#     shell are all coredomains. Nothing on the vendor side has any business
#     learning whether this device filters DNS, and sys.nullroute.filter in
#     particular would tell a vendor blob exactly when the filter is down.
#
# In the AOSP macro set these calls declare the type as well as attaching the
# attribute (system/sepolicy/public/te_macros). If this tree's macros only set
# the attribute, add the two `type ... , property_type;` lines above the calls;
# the build failure is immediate and names the missing type.
#
# nullroute_prop        persist.sys.nullroute.*  — mode, kill, fail_streak, deep
# nullroute_state_prop  sys.nullroute.*          — filter (netd), seed (seeder)
#
# The split matters: persist.* is user/app-authored configuration, sys.* is
# machine-authored health telemetry that only netd and the seeder may write.
# Keeping them as two types is what stops the app from being able to forge the
# very signal it is supposed to be checking (F8).
